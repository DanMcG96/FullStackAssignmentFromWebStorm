# FullStackOne
This is my assignment submission for FullStack Web Development

This PoI application can be used to generate PoI information for Ogham stones in Ireland.

The application is very basic at the moment but supports Cookie Authetication and Users and there categories/placemarks are persistent

## Features

Users can signup/ Login

Cookie authentication means users have unique categories/placemarks

Users can add and delete categories

Users can add and delete placemarks

## Storage

Storage is through JSON

## Deployment

Application is ran from LocalHost Port: 3000

Note (I would have liked to have deployed the app using Glitch but I could not get this to work as the
app wouldn't run. I know it is not ideal to have the app confined to LocalHost but it at least works as expected)

## Tests

There are tests for:

User

Categories

Placemark

## Bugs

Edit user details and edit placemark details don't work. I wanted to implement these features but I just ran out of time

## Reflection

This is not my best work and I am sorely dissapointed in my performance in this assignment. I wanted to aim for completing a number of 
categories at level 3 and maybe some at level 4 but unfortunately I've not been able to break past level 2 at any aspect. 
Time management was a major issue here which meant I was unable to realise my full potential. 
I say this not to garner sympathy - I don't expect it -- but rather to say that my next assignment will not be a repeat of this one.
